    <h2> Introduction: </h2>

    <h3>Love of Databases:</h3>
    <p> Recently I've developed a love of databases. Not just the data they hold, but the structure, 
        the language they're written in, how the data can be manipulated, and the amount of database 
        services that exist. I found this love back in 2021, during a cyber security internship at P&G. While 
        it was a cyber security internship, most of the work was focused on manipulating data in Excel 
        and creating KPI's using PowerBI. In 2022, I switched majors from cyber security to business 
        analytics, and then to a double major in BANA and information systems.
    </p>

    <h3><a href = "https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/history-of-databases-distributed-sql/">The Foundation of Databases:</a></h3>
    <p> Databases are essential for storing, managing, and accessing data, as I learned in my database
        design class last year. They allow users to manipulate and retrieve data to answer specific 
        questions, provided the data exists within the database. Computer databases have been in use
        since the 1960s, but their popularity surged in 1970 when Edgar Codd of IBM published a 
        landmark paper introducing the concept of organizing data into cross-linked tables. This led to 
        the rise of commercial databases, with Oracle launching the first one in 1979.
    </p>
    <img src = "History-of-DBs.png" alt="Timeline of Databases from 1970 to 2019" height="233" width="490">
    <p> Since then, databases have evolved from traditional relational models to include NoSQL solutions, 
        designed for handling unstructured data and large-scale applications. Today, databases are the 
        backbone of everyday systems like social media, e-commerce, and banking, ensuring seamless 
        data transactions and real-time access. They continue to evolve, driven by the demand for faster, 
        more dynamic data management solutions.
    </p>

    <h2>Exploring the Different Types of Databases</h2>
    <p> There are two types of databases that I know of, relational databases and NoSQL databases. 
        Relational databases and NoSQL databases serve different purposes and data models. Relational 
        databases, like MySQL and PostgreSQL, organize data into structured tables with defined 
        relationships, using SQL to query and manage data. In contrast, NoSQL databases, such as
        <span style = "color: #4faa41"> MongoDB </span>, handle unstructured or semi-structured data, offering more flexibility by storing 
        information in documents, key-value pairs, or graphs without predefined schemas
    </p>

        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Popular Database Examples</h3>
    <p> As someone who uses Discord, and is in the process of using Python to make a bot, one of the
        databases I've had to work with is <span style = "color: #4faa41"> MongoDB </span>. <span style = "color: #4faa41"> MongoDB </span> is really useful for verification of
        members and managing members. In order to verify members trying to join a server there has to
        be a database. The database, specifically the servers collection, where the server specific data is
        stored. The python code I'm working on creates, updates, and deletes server-specific data in
        <span style = "color: #4faa41"> MongoDB </span>, including role IDs, premium status, and logging webhooks. It also stores verification
        data to track how many users have been verified. Because <span style = "color: #4faa41"> MongoDB </span> is NoSQL, python code
        works just fine to code it.
    </p>
    <img src="MongoDB Database.png" alt="MongoDB Compass" height="301" width="518">

    <p> In contrast, Oracle is a relational database. You code using SQL to create tables and relationships,
        as well as manipulate and query the database. I've only worked using Oracle during one class 
        learning the different queries you can use to get information from the database as well as 
        learning how to structure the database. In my personal opinion, while I find coding in SQL 
        enjoyable and easy, I do enjoy the ease of working with NoSQL.
    </p>

    <h3>Emerging Database Technologies</h3>
    <p> As the demand for scalability and performance grows, emerging database technologies, 
        such as NewSQL and multi-model databases, are blending the consistency and reliability of relational 
        models with the flexibility and scalability of NoSQL, offering the best of both worlds for todayâ€™s 
        complex data environments.
    </p>

    <h2> Real Life Database Examples </h2>
    <img src="LibraryDatabase.png" alt="A Library Database" height="222" width="515">
    <p> When looking at databases, one of the things I've always been curious about is how bookstore 
        and library databases work. I've always wanted to work at a bookstore and would love to combine 
        my love of databases with my love of reading books. Now I work at a library and while I don't get 
        to work with the databases I do enjoy learning about them.
    </p>
    <p> From what I've learned so far a library database several key elements must be managed, including 
        inventory of books, what library has what book, who has a book on hold, when is the book due, is 
        the book overdue, etc. A relational database is well-suited for handling structured data like patron 
        details, book information, and check out history, where relationships between entities are 
        important. This type of database ensures that information like book availability and user 
        borrowing history is consistent and easily retrievable. Additionally, features like tracking overdue 
        books, sending automated reminders, and managing interlibrary loans rely on the relational 
        structure to keep operations smooth and efficient. 
    </p>
    <p> However, libraries increasingly generate large amounts of unstructured data. Such as digital 
        copies of books, and multimedia content like audiobooks or movies. This is where NoSQL would
        be perfect to handle flexible and growing data. Using a hybrid approach that combines relational 
        databases for structured data and NoSQL for unstructured data allows the library to manage both 
        efficiently.   
    </p>
    <p> I do know that we use a website that use network based access control. Meaning only certain 
        computers with admin access can access the database. The way to access the database is with 
        a simple web application that allows users to simply type in the information they want instead of 
        coding using SQL. I want to assume the database is using a combination of server side and client 
        side code, such as using Python with Vue.js. It could also be using a myriad of other coding 
        languages to accomplish this.
    </p>
    <p> Scalability is also a key factor, especially as libraries expand their digital offerings and
        membership. A hybrid system ensures the library database can scale to accommodate growing 
        user demand, maintain performance during peak periods, and handle large data sets without 
        compromising speed or reliability.
